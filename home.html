      <p>
        Iterative prototyping is an essential part of creating user interfaces.
        Sketches help you visualize your ideas, weigh the benefits of alternative
        designs, and avoid premature decision making. In this project, we will be
        implementing these practices to design an interface for a startup called
        Pod People.
