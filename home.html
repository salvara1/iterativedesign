      <p>
        Iterative prototyping is an essential part of creating user interfaces.
        Sketches help you visualize your ideas, weigh the benefits of alternative
        designs, and avoid premature decision making. In this project, we will be
        implementing these practices to design an interface for a startup called
        Pod People.

    <!-- Sketches -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">Sketching</h2>
      <p>
        In thinking about Pod People's primary users, we wanted to create a visual
        experience that would bring potential customers all of the
        information they would need to know about Pod People in a professional
        environment.

        To start the iterative design process for that environment, we brainstormed
        by sketching 4 possible designs-- each including 3-4 pages. Below you will
        find each set of sketches created during the brainstorming phase.
      </p>
      <h3>Set 1</h3>
      <div class="row_container">
        <img class="img" src="./img/maliquesketch1.png" alt="interface sketch">
        <img class="img" src="./img/maliquesketch2.png" alt="interface sketch">
      </div>

      <h3>Set 2</h3>
      <div class="row_container">
        <img class="img" src="./img/stephsketch1.jpg" alt="interface sketch">
        <img class="img" src="./img/stephsketch3.jpg" alt="interface sketch">
        <img class="img" src="./img/stephsketch2.jpg" alt="interface sketch">
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Data Collection Process -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">Wireframes</h2>
      After discussing each of the sketches in detail, we determined what we
      considered to be the most useful group of pages for Pod People's user group.
      We also discussed the elements of each sketch that we thought could be useful
      in the final design. Taking these elements into consideration, we combined
      the sketches into the one set of 4 wireframes shown below.

        Prototyping + Gathering Feedback
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to prepare for user testing, we created a <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/lxSdID7RVSYXuJ37GEVB9Y/Pod-People?node-id=8%3A198&scaling=contain">
        Figma Hi-Fi prototype.</a> This prototype combined information from
        all of our wireframes into one place. We created a navigatable website
        that contained a home page, a testimonials page, and a registration
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feedback we recieved from our fellow classmates and industry
        profressional included:
        <ul>
          <li>Make text smaller when appropriate </li>
          <li>Add more images and backgrounds</li>
          <li>Background texture, straightforward</li>
          <li>What are the advantages to registering? Timeline? What will happen?</li>
          <li>Marketing and email stuff: name and email first, they select why? Go through like the wizard design</li>
        </ul>
        After incorporating the feedback into our figma design, we moved on into
        user testing.

      <h2 class="title">User Testing</h2>
      <p>
        For our user testing, we conducted a Hypotheses that asked users to
        interact with several portions of our site. We wanted to measure each
        area of our site and access how users navigate through the design of the
        site. In this section you can find the testing guidelines and questions,
        the three user videos, and the post-test follow up questions that were
        conducted.
      </p>
      <h3>Scenario</h3>
      <p>
        You are a young YouTuber that wants to branch out into podcasting.
        You hear about PodPeople, a consulting and engineering service that
        helps people like you grow and build a high-quality podcast. You want
        to register and look at the website testimonials, then sign up for a
        full-service production from PodPeople. You are a novice at podcasting
        and are still in the early development phase of making a podcast.
        This is a prototype website, so there is not full functionality for the
        site. All forms and buttons are interactable. Click on form fields and
        buttons to have them automatically populated.
      </p>
      <h3>Testing Instructions</h3>
      <p>
        <ol>

            clicking anywhere, please explain why.</li>
          <li> Travel to the testimonials page. Was it intuitive to navigate to?
            Was the layout of the testimonials effective in showcasing the
            company's work? </li>
          <li> Did you complete registration for a full-service production?
            What was the most difficult section to follow or understand? Was
            the site easy to navigate? [Success: Yes, No]</li>

      <h3>Follow Up Questions</h3>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            What frustrated you most about this site?
            <ul class="dash">
              <li>Lack of information</li>
              <li>The website was uninteresting to look at and felt like it
                didn't say "hot, new, podcast company"</li>
              <li>Not much, but perhaps that the registration page seemed more
                heavily focused towards the general inquiry section than getting
                 people to actually register. I almost made the mistake of
                 filling out the general inquiry form instead of registering.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you had a magic wand, how would you improve this site?
            <ul class="dash">
              <li>Detailed description of how the company can add value to the users</li>
              <li>I would and brighter colors, pictures of customers and podcast
                 set-ups. More testimonials.</li>
              <li>I would definitely add some color and pictures! Podcasts are
                super fun and energetic and I feel like this website could
                definitely use some of that. It also likely appeals to people
                 who host podcasts.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            What did you like about the site?
            <ul class="dash">
              <li>Easy to navigate</li>
              <li>I like the simplicity and ease of navigating through the tabs.
                 Only three options.</li>
              <li>I really liked the way the website flowed. Buttons went where
                you would expect them to and I didn't feel like information was
                being hidden from me. Everything was upfront and seemed sincere.</li>

            How likely are you to recommend this site to a friend or colleague

      <h2 class="title">Results & analysis</h2>
      <p>
        After viewing the results from our user tests, we thought that the
        results were overall great! Users liked the ease and simplicity of
        the design and could easily navigate through the registration process.
        This was one of our goals of focusing on user registration and engagement
        of the service. One thing that was common and something that should be
        changed is the color scheme. All of the users agreed that the site
        was too "plain", and didn't reflect a webpage that would be for
        podcasters. We would want to find a color scheme that is more reflective
        of the creativity of podcasters. Another addition that users would like
        see are more pictures and content on each page. This would be added on
        a full edition of the page, and we could use the information that we
        didn't pull from the original website.
