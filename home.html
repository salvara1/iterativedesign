    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
      In this project, I coupled my love for succulents with my interest in
      analytics to perform an A/B test and statistical analysis to gather insight
      into two different UI designs for an online succulent store. At this succulent
      store, every user must place at least $150 worth of plants into their
      shopping cart.

    <!-- Developing B -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">Developing Design B</h2>
      <p class="text_before_image">
        To start this process, I needed to alter a UI design in a way that could
        potentially affect some of the metrics being tracked on the site. Below you will find
        an image of design A and an
        annotated screenshot of what I changed in the 'B' UI design as well as why I changed it.
        In the next section, you can learn more about how I projected these changes would
        affect the user experience.

    <!-- Hypotheses -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title"> Hypotheses</h2>
      <p>
        Before I could continue in evaluating these changes through an A/B test,
        I needed to determine my expectations by creating hypotheses. In this
        particular test, I wanted to gain insight into the effects of these
        changes on two metrics:
      </p>

      <div class="">
        <h3> 1. Return Rate Hypotheses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u> <b>Context: </b> </u> In design A, the user cannot see the total cost of their cart
                  until they navigate to the checkout page. Because the user's goal is to obtain
                  at least $150 in plants, I made the following hypotheses.</li>
          <li>
            <u> <b>Alternative Hypothesis: </b> </u> If users can check the total dollar amount in their carts
            on the shopping page, then the return rate will decrease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u> <b>Null Hypothesis: </b> </u> If users can check the total dollar amount in
            their carts onthe shopping page, then the return rate will either
            remain the same or decrease.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h3> 2. Time to Completion Hypotheses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u> <b>Context: </b> </u> In design A, the user must scroll to the bottom of
            the page to view all of the succulents and the checkout button.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u> <b>Alternative Hypothesis: </b> </u> If the user can see all of the products and the checkout
            button without needing to scroll, the time to completion will decrease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u> <b>Null Hypothesis: </b> </u>If the user can see all of the products and the checkout
            button without needing to scroll, the time to completion will either increase or remain the same.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Data Collection Process -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        To collect data for the A/B test, I asked my section classmates, friends,
        and family to navigate the online store. Upon arrival to the store, either
        design A or B was displayed to the user. Each user was also given a task-- to
        add at least $150 worth of plants to the shopping cart.
        <br>
        <br>
        I ended the test with 23 unique users. 12 used A and 11 used B.

        Tests and Results
      </h2>
      <p>
        To test my hypotheses, I conducted two statistical tests, a t-test for
        the time to completion hypothesis and a chi-squared test for the return rate hypothesis.
        Below is an infographic detailing the process and results
      </p>

    <!-- Takeaways -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="title">Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        I was a bit surprised by the results of the tests, as I was expecting them to be more
        significant; however there
        were certain that I think affected the results.
        The first being that many of my users were using the page repetitively,
        and they knew the goals and purpose of the assignment. In the future, I would
        cast a wider, more diverse net. I also think the content of checkout page
        played a larger role in return rate than either A or B. Users who enter the checkout
        page are only presented with one option
        "go back to shopping." I think this was the cause for signifiantly more returns, as a
        large portion of users who returned didn't actually add any additional items to their carts.
        In the future, I would be interested in running an A/B test on the checkout page!
